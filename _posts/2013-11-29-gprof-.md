GPROF 使用
=============
项目地址：http://www.cs.utah.edu/dept/old/texinfo/as/gprof.html

gprof是一个 可以通过运行程序，确定程序函数的执行时间。

这个程序依赖gcc -g -pg ，通过这个可以获取丰富的调试信息，供我们以后代码优化使用。

首先我们用一个example开阐述这个工具如何使用。比如我们现在有一个.c

<pre><code>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
void f1() 
{
    int i;
    int *p;
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
    {
        p = malloc(sizeof(int));
        *p = 10;
        free(p);
    }
}
void f2() 
{
    int i;
    int *p;
    for (i = 0; i < 20; i++) 
    {
        p = malloc(sizeof(int));
        *p = 10;
        free(p);
    }
}
void f3() 
{
    int i;
    int *p;
    for (i = 0; i < 30; i++) 
    {
        p = malloc(sizeof(int));
        *p = 10;
        free(p);
    }
}
   
int main() 
{
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) 
    {
        f1();
        f2();
        f3();
    }
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

然后我们使用gcc -g -pg命令进行编译。

如果我们直接运行的话，目录下会生成一个gmon.out的文件。里面记录了程序运行cpu的使用信息。

但是我们直接无法查看，所以我们使用

<pre><code>
[root@localhost code]#gprof ./gprof gmon.out > report.txt

 %         the percentage of the total running time of the
time       program used by this function.
 
cumulative a running sum of the number of seconds accounted
 seconds   for by this function and those listed above it.
 
 self      the number of seconds accounted for by this
seconds    function alone.  This is the major sort for this
           listing.
 
calls      the number of times this function was invoked, if
           this function is profiled, else blank.
  
 self      the average number of milliseconds spent in this
ms/call    function per call, if this function is profiled,
       else blank.
 
 total     the average number of milliseconds spent in this
ms/call    function and its descendents per call, if this 
       function is profiled, else blank.
 
name       the name of the function.  This is the minor sort
           for this listing. The index shows the location of
       the function in the gprof listing. If the index is
       in parenthesis it shows where it would appear in
       the gprof listing if it were to be printed.

 This table describes the call tree of the program, and was sorted by
 the total amount of time spent in each function and its children.
 
 Each entry in this table consists of several lines.  The line with the
 index number at the left hand margin lists the current function.
 The lines above it list the functions that called this function,
 and the lines below it list the functions this one called.
 This line lists:
     index  A unique number given to each element of the table.
        Index numbers are sorted numerically.
        The index number is printed next to every function name so
        it is easier to look up where the function in the table.
 
     % time This is the percentage of the `total' time that was spent
        in this function and its children.  Note that due to
        different viewpoints, functions excluded by options, etc,
        these numbers will NOT add up to 100%.
 
     self   This is the total amount of time spent in this function.
 
     children   This is the total amount of time propagated into this
        function by its children.
 
     called This is the number of times the function was called.
        If the function called itself recursively, the number
        only includes non-recursive calls, and is followed by
        a `+' and the number of recursive calls.
 
     name   The name of the current function.  The index number is
        printed after it.  If the function is a member of a
        cycle, the cycle number is printed between the
        function's name and the index number.
 
 
 For the function's parents, the fields have the following meanings:
 
     self   This is the amount of time that was propagated directly
        from the function into this parent.
 
     children   This is the amount of time that was propagated from
        the function's children into this parent.
 
     called This is the number of times this parent called the
        function `/' the total number of times the function
        was called.  Recursive calls to the function are not
        included in the number after the `/'.
 
     name   This is the name of the parent.  The parent's index
        number is printed after it.  If the parent is a
        member of a cycle, the cycle number is printed between
        the name and the index number.
 
 If the parents of the function cannot be determined, the word
 `<spontaneous>' is printed in the `name' field, and all the other
 fields are blank.
 
 For the function's children, the fields have the following meanings:
 
     self   This is the amount of time that was propagated directly
        from the child into the function.
 
     children   This is the amount of time that was propagated from the
        child's children to the function.
 
     called This is the number of times the function called
        this child `/' the total number of times the child
        was called.  Recursive calls by the child are not
        listed in the number after the `/'.
 
     name   This is the name of the child.  The child's index
        number is printed after it.  If the child is a
        member of a cycle, the cycle number is printed
        between the name and the index number.
 
 If there are any cycles (circles) in the call graph, there is an
 entry for the cycle-as-a-whole.  This entry shows who called the
 cycle (as parents) and the members of the cycle (as children.)
 The `+' recursive calls entry shows the number of function calls that
 were internal to the cycle, and the calls entry for each member shows,
 for that member, how many times it was called from other members of
 the cycle.

通过上面，我们可以看到每个函数占用cpu的时间，如果生成一个png图，显得更加直观，方便以后写论文的时候测试。

Gprof2Dot：https://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/Gprof2Dot#Download

从里面下载一个python文件。

<pre><code>
[root@localhost code]# gprof ./gprof | python gprof2dot.py | dot -Tpng -o output.png
[root@localhost code]# ls
gmon.out  gprof2dot.py  output.png  swap    swap.s
gprof     gprof.c       report.txt  swap.c
</code></pre>

发现目录下面，我们会发现一个output.png。打开就是我们这个测试程序的图片.
