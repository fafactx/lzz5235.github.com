Title of document

 This working instruction outlines the CMs responsibility in
 handling team members commits that are to enter the blessed
 repository

1 Managing Commits

 The CM needs to confirm every team member's git commit and then 
 merge it to the master git repository (blessed repostory) if
 the following critieria are met.

 * The commit is one idea/concept only (may be distributed over
   multiple files though)
 * The commit is small enough to be understood by review of the
   diff - generally this implies that the indificual commit is
   a few pages only, for code it should probably be less than 50
   LoC - exceptions are possible though.
 * The commit message discribes the content of the commit adequately
   and completely.
 * The committers name is a real name 
 * The committers e-mail is a valid public address (no root@debian)
 * The commit is signed off by the committer

2. Commit Conflic Resolution

 * In case of trivial conflicts that do not impact content the
   CM can fix it up *AND* notify the involved parties of the fixup
 * If a conflict can not be resolved then the commit is rejected
   and both involved parties are to be informed by e-mail.
 * Reverting of conflicting previous commits should be avaided if
   possible - if it is found necessary it should be clearly indicated
   in the revert commit message of CM (as well as notification of the 
   original commit author)

3. QA: of CMS

 * Statistics of commits, merges, conflicts and rejects shall be
   provided
 * For rejected commits the reasons for reject shall be categorized as
   follows:
   * Bad commit message
   * Too large commits 
   * Missing credentials (signoff, e-mail or author name)
   (lets try and keep it at these three)

4. Training on GIT

 * CM need to give a training when new member join in
 * GIT/CMS trainings shall be recorded


5. Every member should take turns as a CM for one or two
   month

Terms:

 * blessed repository - the reference repository shared by all
   team members - it is read-only for all except the CM.

Acronyns:

CM  - Configuration Manager 
CMS - Configuration Management System
GIT - the stupid content tracker (man git)
